#### Abstract

Venus is like the Earth in terms of size and mass but has a very different atmosphere and is completely shrouded by thick sulfuric acid clouds. We learned the details of the atmosphere thanks to several space missions (1960-2007) of the USSR and the USA, and new discoveries were added by the most recent Venus orbiters: European Venus Express (2006-2014) and Japanese Akatsuki (2015-current). These recent missions revealed temporally variable atmospheric properties, such as trace gaseous abundances, wind speeds, wave activities, and reflectivity of the clouds. I would like to introduce current hot issues on this hot planet. The future of Venus research is bright with three confirmed Venus missions by the USA and Europe. I would like to introduce what I plan to do in Korea while collaborating with these international teams.
